= NIST publication identifiers ("NIST PubID")

== Purpose

NIST publications are numbered according to an identification scheme.

This gem implements a mechanism to parse and utilize NIST publication identifiers
provided in the https://github.com/usnistgov/NIST-Tech-Pubs[NIST-Tech-Pubs]
repository.

This gem is introduced in the Metanorma blog post
https://www.metanorma.org/blog/2022-01-09-pubid-nist/["Introducing NIST PubID, and the migration of publication identifiers"] on 2022-01-09.

For further details on the Metanorma work on the NIST PubID, refer to the
https://riboseinc.github.io/report-pubid-nist/["Ribose comments to Publication Identifier Syntax for NIST Technical Series Publications"]
document.

== Historic identifier patterns

There are at least three major "pattern series" of identifiers due to historical
reasons:

* NIST publications produced by the PubID scheme (202X-)
* NIST publications produced prior to the PubID scheme (1988-)
* NBS publications, produced under the National Bureau of Standards (the
  previous name of NIST, 1901 to 1988)

This implementation attempts to support all three types of publication
identifier patterns.

== NIST PubID

NIST is currently developing a unified publication identifier scheme ("PubID")
for their technical series of publications, which allows machine-readable
identifier parts.

This scheme is described in "`Publication Identifier Syntax for NIST Technical
Series Publications`" authored by
https://www.nist.gov/people/james-foti[Jim Foti]
of the https://www.nist.gov/itl/csd[CSD, ITL], and
https://www.nist.gov/people/kathryn-miller[Kathryn Miller] and
https://www.nist.gov/people/kate-bucher[Kate Bucher] of the
https://www.nist.gov/associate-director-management-resources/staff-offices/information-services-office[ISO],
Management Resources.

NOTE: This scheme is still at proposal stage.

This gem implements the NIST PubID scheme and allows the conversion to and from
historic patterns.


== Use cases to support

PubID:

. Given a PubID (full-form title, abbreviated-form title, short-form title),
  generate the corresponding machine-readable (MR) PubID format
. Given a MR PubID:
.. generate the full-form title
.. generate the abbreviated-form title
.. generate short-form title
.. generate the DOI (which is just DOI ID + MR)

Historic compatibility:

. Parse a historic publication identifier into its components:
.. output the original publication identifier (i.e. store the contents in the
  object)
.. output a MR PubID

. Parse a historic DOI into a PubID:
.. output the original DOI (i.e. store the contents in the object)
.. output a MR PubID

== CLI conversion tool

We implemented an open-source conversion tool that extracts the required PubID data elements from existing NIST Tech Pubs metadata, such as the legacy identifier, DOI, edition and publication date information, to generate the new PubID.
`pubid-nist` provides a CLI (Command-Line Interface) and a Ruby library that can be used to create and manipulate PubID objects.

== Installation

The only prerequisite is to have Ruby installed. Please refer to the official https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/[Ruby installation guide].

The pubid-nist tool can be installed as follows.

[source,sh]
----
$ gem install pubid-nist
----

Now you should be able to use the pubid-nist command.

=== Usage

=== Installation

The only prerequisite is to have Ruby installed. Please refer to the
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/[official Ruby installation guide].

The `pubid-nist` tool can be installed as follows.

[source,sh]
----
$ gem install pubid-nist
----

Now you should be able to use the `pubid-nist` command.

When called without arguments (or as `pubid-nist help`) the help screen will
be shown.

[source,sh]
----
$ pubid-nist
Commands:
  pubid-nist convert         # Convert legacy NIST Tech Pubs ID to NIST PubID
  pubid-nist help [COMMAND]  # Describe available commands or one specific command
  pubid-nist report          # Create report for NIST Tech Pubs database (fetches from GitHub)
----

=== Converting a legacy identifier to NIST PubID

The command `pubid-nist` provides a `convert` subcommand that converts a legacy
Nist Tech Pubs identifier into the NIST PubID format.

Here's how it can be used:

[source,sh]
----
$ pubid-nist help convert
Usage:
  pubid-nist convert

Options:
  -s, [--style=STYLE]    # Convert to PubID style (short|long|mr|abbrev)
                         # Default: short
  -f, [--format=FORMAT]  # Render in format (JSON, string)
                         # Default: string

Convert legacy NIST Tech Pubs ID to NIST PubID
----

[source,sh]
----
$ pubid-nist convert "NIST SP 800-53a"
NIST SP 800-53A
$ pubid-nist convert "NIST SP 800-57p1r3"
NIST SP 800-57pt1r3
----

The `convert` command also supports DOI conversion.

[source,sh]
----
$ pubid-nist convert "NIST.SP.800-57p1r3"
NIST SP 800-57pt1r3
----

In addition to outputting PubID short style, we can also output other styles
and formats of the resulting PubID.

[source,sh]
----
$ pubid-nist convert -s mr "NIST SP 800-53a"
NIST.SP.800-53A
$ pubid-nist convert -s long -f json "NIST SP 800-53a" | jq
{
  "styles": {
    "short": "NIST SP 800-53A",
    "abbrev": "Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. Spec. Publ. 800-53A",
    "long": "National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-53A",
    "mr": "NIST.SP.800-53A"
  },
  "publisher": "NIST",
  "serie": "NIST SP",
  "code": "800-53A"
}
----

=== Generating the bulk NIST Tech Pubs migration report

This is the nice part -- a single command that generates the full table of
converted PubIDs from the NIST Tech Pubs database, comprising of 19,333
entries.

The `report` command can be used as follows:

[source,sh]
----
$ pubid-nist help report
Usage:
  pubid-nist report

Options:
  [--csv], [--no-csv]  # Export to CSV format

Create report for NIST Tech Pubs database (fetches from GitHub)
----

The purpose of this command is to aid the NIST PubID team in assessing the
impact and type of changes to be made in enacting this new scheme.

By default, the `report` command generates a table to indicate which migrated
identifiers have changed, focusing on changes of two styles:

* PubID in short style vs legacy publication ID
* PubID in machine-readable style vs legacy DOI

As seen in the following output, a `✅` or a `-` will be shown in the appropriate
column of change.

[source,sh]
----
$ pubid-nist report
ID changed? | New PubID | Document ID | DOI changed? | New PubID-MR | DOI | Title
 - | NBS BH 1 | NBS BH 1 |  - | NBS.BH.1 | NBS.BH.1 | Recommended minimum requirements for small dwelling construction : report of Building Code Committee July 20, 1922

----


Better yet, the `report` command supports CSV output. The "changes" fields
will display `true` or `false` accordingly.

[source,sh]
----
$ pubid-nist report --csv
ID changed?,New PubID,Document ID,DOI changed?,New PubID-MR,DOI,Title

true,NIST IR 8379,NISTIR 8379,false,NIST.IR.8379,NIST.IR.8379,Summary Report for the Virtual Workshop Addressing Public Comment on NIST Cybersecurity for IoT Guidance
----


The best part is that this CSV will work properly with spreadsheet editors like
Excel and Pages.
All you need is to export the CSV values to a CSV file, and open it in your
favorite program.

[source,sh]
----
$ pubid-nist report --csv > myreport.csv
----

It is easy to filter these columns in Microsoft Excel with the following steps:

. Open the CSV file in Excel
. Convert the header row into a filter row:
  first highlight the header row, then click on "Data > Filter"
. Filter the columns accordingly

|===

=== Stage

The stage code element only applies to non-final publications.

In most series, documents are only released as final publications, and therefore
their PubIDs will not contain a stage code.

Only some series support stage codes, e.g. SP 800 and SP 1800.

|===
| Name | Value

| Initial Public Draft | IPD
| Second Public Draft (to the Nth Public Draft) | 2PD (... nPD)
| Final Public Draft | FPD
| Work-in-Progress Draft | WD
| Preliminary Draft | PreD

|===

=== Report number

The contents and pattern of the report number are dependent on the series.

Possible values:

* {sequence number}
* {subseries}-{sequence number}
* {sequence number}-{volume}
* {sequence number}-{edition}
* {subseries}-{sequence number}-{edition}
* etc.

A "Part" can also be indicated by an appended alphabetic character to the end.

=== Part

|===
| Name | Abbrev and Short | MR

| Part | Pt. | `pt`
| Volume | Vol. | `v`
| Section | Sec. | `sec`
| Supplement | Suppl. | `sup`
| Index | Index | `indx`
| Addendum | Add. | `add` (TBC with NIST)
| Insert | Ins. | `ins` (TBC with NIST)
| Errata | Err. | `err` (TBC with NIST)
| Appendix | App. | `app` (TBC with NIST)

|===

=== Edition

|===
| Name | Abbrev and Short | MR

| Revision | Rev. | `r`
| Edition | Ed. | `e`
| Version | Ver. | `ver`

|===

=== Translation

An ISO 639-2 code that represents a translated document from English.

If a document is translated from English, suffix the document with a 3-letter
ISO 639-2 code within parentheses.

Raw values seen in legacy DOIs include:

|===
| Name | Correct value | MR | Legacy values seen in DOI

| Spanish | (ESP) | `esp` | `es`
| Vietnamese | (VIE) | `vie` | `viet`
| Portuguese | (POR) | `por` | `port` `pt`
| Chinese | (ZHO) | `zho` | `chi`
| Indonesian | (IND) | `ind` | `id`

|===

=== Update

==== General

When a document is updated with an errata, the original edition may be reissued
to include the errata.

These documents will display the text "includes updates as of...".

In this case the document identifier will include the element "Update".

|===
| Name | Abbrev and Short | MR

| Update | Upd. | `u`

|===

NOTE: This is similar to the ISO/IEC "Amd." and "Cor." except that the NIST
"Upd." is applied to the original document and (typically) does not exist
separately.

==== Update number

A sequential integer numbering of the update counting from the original document.

The first update is numbered 1, and so forth.

==== Update year

The year last updated, shown as a suffix to the identifier.

* "{identifier}:{update-year}"


== PubID patterns

=== Presentation

Generally in this order:

* No update: `{series} {stage} {report number}{part}{edition}({translation})`
* With update: `{series} {stage} {report number}{part}{edition}({translation})/{update} {update number}:{update year}`


=== Full PubID

Samples:

* National Institute of Standards and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 199
* National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-27, Revision A
* National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-39 (Second Public Draft)

(originally described in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-nist/issues/98)

=== Abbreviated PubID

This form is used in the Authority section.

----
Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. {abbrev(series)} {reportnumber} {part | abbrev(volume)}, {abbrev(revision)}
----

* `abbrev(series)` represent the abbreviation of the Series title
* (Note: there is no `{update-date}`)

Examples:

* "Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. Spec. Publ. 800-78-4"
* "Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. Spec. Publ. 800-116"
* "Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. Spec. Publ. 800-57 Part 1, Revision 4"


(originally from https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-nist/issues/88)

=== Short PubID

The "short form" is used to cite the documents within text.

It is used in these situations:

1. Locality references. "In Section 3.2 of SP 800-187…" (the "SP 800-187" is a link).

NOTE: NIST pubs are composed of "Sections" not "Clauses"

2. A generic document reference. "SP 800-53 describes…". This form does not specify a revision or update date.

3. "All parts". "The SP 800-57 subseries describes key management…".

("NISTIR 6885 2003 Edition (February 2003)" is a poor indicator.)

The correct rule should be:

----
{abbrev(series)} {reportnumber} {abbrev(volume)} {abbrev(revision)} {edition, optional}
----

NOTE: For FIPS, `reportnumber` is the full FIPS number, including revision, e.g.,
`140-2`.

Short form date:

* `Month YYYY`

Examples:

* NIST SP 800-53r4 (20152201) supersedes NIST SP 800-53r4 (20140115)
* NIST SP 800 63A (December 2017) supersedes NIST SP 800-63A
* NIST SP 800 57 Part 1 Revision 4 supersedes NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Revision 3 ("Rev." is also accepted, and converted to "Revision")
* NIST SP 800 160 Volume 1 supersedes NIST SP 800-160 (20180103) ("Vol." is also accepted, and converted to "Volume")
* Undated form "NIST SP 800 53r4"

Strip Revision and Date from title, only if the Revision and Date are unique for
each document number. These are identified as "Rev. ...", "Revision ...." and "
(Month YYYY)", whichever comes first.


=== Machine-readable PubID

Machine-readable syntax:

----
{publisher}.{series}.[{stage}.]{reportnumber}.{part}.{revision}.[{lang}.]{update-date}
----

----
{publisher}.{series}.[{stage}.]{reportnumber}.{part}.{revision}.[{lang}.][{update}]{update-date}
----

Generally, this rule should be able to uniquely identify an edition of a document.

* `{part}`
** Part
*** A "Part 1" document is encoded as "pt1";
*** When a letter part is indicated, e.g. "800-63A", we should keep it as part of
  the reportnumber (i.e., don't indicate "pt").

** Volumes
*** "Volume 1" is encoded as "v1";

* `{revision}`
** "Revision 1" is encoded as "r1"

** If a superseding edition is a full revision, it will get the next Rev. #.
** If a superseding edition is just an errata update, we use the update date
from the title page ("includes updates as of ...") to uniquely identify this
edition. Preferably in the `-yyyymmdd` format.

* `{update}`
** "Update 1" is encoded as "upd1"

Some examples:

* `NIST.SP.800-53r4-20152201` supersedes `NIST.SP.800-53r4-20140115`
* `NIST.SP.800-63A-20171201` supersedes `NIST.SP.800-63A`
* `NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4` supersedes `NIST.SP.800-57pt1r3`
* `NIST.SP.800-160v1` supersedes `NIST.SP.800-160-20180103`
* `NIST.IR.8204.upd1-2019` supersedes `NIST.IR.8204`
* The undated form is `NIST.SP.800-53r4`
